# 2026-11-10 12:07 UTC — System-test reliability follow-ups

## TL;DR

**Why:** The storefront work turned up a set of system-test problems that are not part of building the storefront: an intermittent .NET CI failure with no root cause, failed CI runs that keep no evidence, leaked fake-server data, language gaps in the test kit, unreliable local .NET runs, and three older issues. None of them blocks the storefront, but together they make a red pipeline slow to diagnose and a local run hard to trust as a gate.
**End result:** A failed acceptance stage uploads the stub journal, mappings and container logs, so the next intermittent failure can be diagnosed from one run. No language leaks dynamic stubs, and .NET/TS verify each stub after registering it, as Java does. The deploy-stage simulators run on one instance. The cloud stage is proven to test the current frontend image, and pushing to `main` mid-run no longer breaks `meta-prerelease-stage`. Locally, `test-all.sh` rebuilds images, stops each stack (also when cut off), and its memory limits are documented. .NET runs no longer flake on Keycloak tokens or fail always-red hidden tests, and lint agrees on Windows and Linux. All backends send `application/problem+json`, and the Node projects' high/critical `npm audit` findings are fixed or noted. Six ideas stay deferred (#5, #15, #17, #20, #21, #26) and two are dropped (#8c, #10). Unchanged: no production code behaviour apart from #8b's content type, and no new infrastructure cost.

## ▶ Next executable step (resume here)

Session 2026-11-10 did #1, #2, #3 (full latest acceptance runs per language on monolith stacks: .NET 363/363, Java 231 passed/0 failed/74 skipped, TS 250/250; afterwards each stub server held only its 18 static mappings, 0 dynamic, so no Java/TS leak), #4, #6, #7 (b) (token retry in all three languages; 0 token failures and 0 retries across the acceptance and sample runs), #8a, #8b, #9, #12, #13, #14 (system-test/typescript high 1 → 0; still deferred, needing a breaking major bump: postcss via next 16 (monolith), `@pact-foundation/pact` 17 (backend-typescript, frontend-react), vitest 5 (frontend-react, critical), and backend-typescript brace-expansion <=1.1.20, pinned by its dependent), #16 (now `gh-optivem/plans/20261110-2109-system-test-per-suite-counts.md`), #18, #19, #22–#25 and #28; #10 and #8c dropped.

**Waiting on the user:** #11 is user-side. (#27 committed in `actions` as `1139063`, 2026-11-10.)

**Next executable unit:** #29, re-run `monolith-java-acceptance-stage.yml` and `monolith-dotnet-acceptance-stage.yml` on current `main` (cloud, costs a little; ask the user first) and triage per its recommendation.

**Deferred:** #5, #15, #17, #20, #21, #26 (see their ideas below).

## Background: the .NET "does not exist" failures (found 2026-11-10, root cause fixed)

- **Symptom:** from `9da17ffc` onwards, the cloud .NET acceptance stages failed on every attempt (4 of 4). Several API tests per run failed with `Product does not exist for SKU: DEFAULT-SKU-…` or `Country does not exist: UK-…`. Java and TypeScript passed, and so did the .NET docker-compose stages.
- **Root cause:** `.github/workflows/_acceptance-stage.yml` deployed the external-systems Cloud Run service (WireMock stubs, json-server simulator) with `--max-instances 2`. Both keep their state in memory, separately on each instance. Under parallel test load Cloud Run scaled out, so a stub a test registered on one instance was missing when the backend's lookup landed on the other. `f1ca8b7d` added many .NET tests, which pushed the load over the scale-out threshold.
- **Fix:** capped at `--max-instances 1` (commit `c068ab47`, 2026-11-10), following the precedent of the monolith deploy, which is already capped at 1 for its in-memory session state. Cloud Run instance counts were not checked directly, because local `gcloud` is broken (see #11).
- **Ruled out on the way:** shared-profile leaks (the backend takes the country from the request, `system/monolith/dotnet/Core/Services/OrderService.cs:105`), DSL ordering, cross-test stub deletion, static stub files, and WireMock itself.
- **Lesson:** a failure that shows only in the cloud stage and never in docker-compose points at the cloud infrastructure. #1 (keep evidence) would have shown the request landing on a stub server with no matching mapping.

## Resolved decisions

Decided by the user on 2026-11-10: #1–#3 one at a time, then "I automatically approve of all of your suggestions" for #4–#27. Each one takes the recommendation written in its idea below.

**Do (21):**
- **#1 keep failure evidence:** first.
- **#2 .NET tax-stub leak.**
- **#3 Java/TS leak check:** with #2.
- **#4 stub read-back (.NET, TS):** after #1.
- **#6 local .NET restore:** a small check. If it's a setup gap, raise a gh-optivem plan.
- **#7 Windows parallel runs:** option (b), retry Keycloak token acquisition, then measure again.
- **#8a `DefaultGivensTest` null channel:** fix the test.
- **#8b problem+json content type:** fix .NET, and check the other five backends.
- **#9 deploy-stage simulators:** cap at `--max-instances 1`.
- **#11 local gcloud:** set `CLOUDSDK_PYTHON` on both machines (user-side).
- **#12 stale image, or the UI case missing from the cloud stage:** soon.
- **#13 anonymous cancel/deliver parity:** with #12.
- **#14 `npm audit` triage:** across every Node project.
- **#16 per-suite summary line:** in gh-optivem, as its own plan there.
- **#18 `.editorconfig` LF for C#.**
- **#19 `ShopWebApplicationFactory`:** ignore `TransactionIgnoredWarning`.
- **#22 document the low-memory workaround:** in CONTRIBUTING.md.
- **#23 `test-all.sh` stops stacks:** after each language.
- **#24 `test-all.sh --restart` passthrough.**
- **#25 `test-all.sh` EXIT trap:** with #23.
- **#27 meta dispatch matches the child run without `head_sha`:** done (`actions` `1139063`).

**Defer:** #5 (stub reset at suite start), #15 (`next start` standalone), #17 (split `SecurityConfigTest`), #20 (non-UTC CI timezone), #21 (HTML logger control character), #26 (RC tag push; revisit only if it recurs).

**Drop:** #8c (covered by `test-all.sh` legacy runs), #10 (`_stubIds` thread safety; theoretical).

## Ideas to decide

Each idea has a recommendation, and every one is decided (see "Resolved decisions").

### 5. Reset the stub server at the start of a suite run

Even with #2 fixed, a long-lived local stack accumulates any stubs a crashed or killed test run leaves behind. Option: reset dynamic mappings at suite start (`POST /__admin/mappings/reset`, which keeps the file-based static mappings), or on `gh optivem system start --restart`.
- **Recommended: defer.** #2 and #3 remove the known leaks. Revisit if leftovers still pile up.
- Note: a reset at suite start must never run while another suite is using the same stub server.

### 11. Fix local `gcloud`

Local `gcloud` fails because it doesn't support Python 3.13. It needs `CLOUDSDK_PYTHON` pointing at Python 3.8–3.12. That blocked checking the Cloud Run instance counts directly.
- **Recommended: do, once per machine.** Set `CLOUDSDK_PYTHON` in your shell profile on both machines. Note it in `CONTRIBUTING.md` if other contributors use `gcloud`.

### 15. `next start` doesn't work with `output: "standalone"` locally

With `output: "standalone"`, `next start` warns that it doesn't work, and the standalone server serves no `/_next/static` unless that folder is copied in. Docker is fine, because the Dockerfile copies it. It only affects running the monolith outside Docker.
- **Recommended: defer.** No documented workflow runs it outside Docker. If one appears, add an npm script that copies the static folder or runs `node .next/standalone/server.js`.

### 17. `SecurityConfigTest` (Java monolith) is at the checkstyle file-length limit

`system/monolith/java` `SecurityConfigTest` is 496 lines, against checkstyle's 500-line limit, so the Thymeleaf port had to put new security tests in `StorefrontPagesTest`.
- **Recommended: defer.** Splitting it by area (public routes, customer routes, admin routes) is a refactor with no behaviour change. Do it the next time someone has to add a security test.

### 20. Local runs depend on the machine's timezone

The .NET admin-coupons bug (fixed in storefront Step 6) was only caught because this machine is set to CET, while CI runners are UTC. Other timezone bugs would also pass CI unnoticed.
- **Recommended: defer, but consider.** One option is to run one CI UI job with a non-UTC browser timezone (Playwright `timezoneId`, e.g. `Europe/Berlin`), so timezone bugs show up in CI.

### 21. .NET test runs print an HTML logger error

`dotnet test` prints `Html Logger Error : '', hexadecimal value 0x1A, is an invalid character.` The run still passes, but the HTML report may be incomplete. Something in the test output (a log line or test name) contains a control character.
- **Recommended: defer.** It is cosmetic. Look into it if anyone relies on the HTML report.

### 26. Cloud acceptance stage failed to push the RC tag

`meta-prerelease-stage` run 42660796447 (2026-11-09 17:03, `ac04be12`) failed all six pipelines in `verify / cloud-acceptance-stage` with `Failed to push tag monolith-java-v1.0.237-rc.3363 (remote: , local: ac04be12…)`. The tests weren't the cause. The next runs on 2026-11-10 pushed tags for monolith without a problem, so it looks transient (a race between parallel tag pushes, or a GitHub hiccup), but the empty `remote:` field hides the real error.
- **Recommended: investigate if it recurs.** Make the tag-push step print git's stderr and retry once on a non-fast-forward or a network error.


### 29. Cloud-only monolith UI failures in `meta-prerelease-stage` 42888911339

Found 2026-11-10 (run on `e8e471a1`, before #13's driver change). Only `verify / cloud-acceptance-stage` failed, and only on UI tests; the docker-compose stages for the same languages were green:
- monolith-java (run 42901251872): `MyShopSmokeTest.shouldBeAbleToGoToMyShop [Channel: UI]`, Playwright `Timeout 30000ms exceeded`.
- monolith-dotnet (run 42902460098): `DeliverOrderPositiveTest.AdminShouldBeAbleToDeliverAnotherCustomersOrder(UI)`, `Order status not updated to DELIVERED`.
- **Recommended: re-run the two cloud acceptance stages on current `main` first.** If they pass, treat this as cloud UI latency and consider a longer UI wait for the cloud stage only. If either repeats, use #1's uploaded evidence (compose/Cloud Run logs) to diagnose. Lesson from the "does not exist" background: cloud-only means look at the cloud infra first.
